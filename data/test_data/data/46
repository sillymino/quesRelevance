Question: After 5 months of Visit Visa my 3 yo son and i are travelling back home on May 11, 2013. Do we need any exit permit to do this? Your answers will be much appreciated thank u! ||', Comment Subject: If you are a lady working <br><br>Comment Body:If you are a lady working with a company here in Qatar, then you need to get an exit permit from your company. But if your visit has been sponsored by your husband, then you &amp; your son dont need an exit permit.  If you are a male 18 years or more then you need to get an exit permit in any case.  Children up to the age of 18years (i.e. 17 years and 11 months) dont need any exit permit.<br><br>||', Question: After 5 months of Visit Visa my 3 yo son and i are travelling back home on May 11, 2013.
