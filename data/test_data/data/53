And I am not being racist here, The US Embassy here is going to want to see what the reason you wish to visit, Do you have a good job here?(Do you have enough money in your bank account) Do you have Family here that is not going with you?(What are the reasons you would acctully come back from your visit) Do you have Family in the US?(Are you going to enter the US and not leave) Why are you appling here?(Are you trying to escape something) Not to be mean but many filipino go on a tourist visa to the US and never leave or stay illeagally in the US about 150,000 every year...<br><br>||', Question: Does having a personal loan affects the outcome of getting a US tourist visa  here in Doha? ||', Comment Subject: .... <br><br>Comment Body:My family lives here and Ive been here working for 7 years in a US company under a semi government organization.

If you can show that you can support yourself, have a good reason to want to visit, and show that you have ties, obligations, and good reasons why you will return form your visit. They will issue a visa, but it will be upto the officer at the window. I do not think the NOC is even one of the requirements, that is a Qatar thing.

Its mentioned behind the invoice that the items can be exchanged within 15 days in case of manufacturing defect. Since u dont hv manufacturing defect, i think on paper u cannot.  If box is not opened yet.    Can be easily exchanged. Else if box is opened but not torned    Request can be made   Leaving papers aside, practically seeing i think should be exchanged. Good luck.<br><br>||', Question: I bought a Sony LCD Model: BX32, 32 on the 9th September 2010. But now I want to change it and buy a 40 Sony LCD. I have the receipt.
