ASD is the only US curriculum school here that I know off, but there is plenty of choice for the English system.  If you plan to be in the UK itself after your time here or want to follow the national curriculum of EnglandWales, then DESS and Doha College are the best fit.

I tried to enroll my kids to TEK kindergarten but then i found out that most of the teachers are NOT teachers. they do not hold a teaching degree nor are sponsor by the school. I dont know if this happening in everyplace here in Doha? It is really disppointing to know our kids are going to a kindergarten which has not qualified personel and we trust them with our kids. Who will be reponsible if something happens? I send a letter to SEC (Supreme Education Council) but they havent reply. money is not an issue when we are talking about our kids education, but what education if they are with people we dont know who they are, where ther are coming from.

My daughter will be four in June and sadly we will be leaving Doha Qatar. My daughter started there in September 2009 and she was in the nursery at TEK then moved into Preschool. When my daughter started at the school the nursery and Kindergarten were in the same premises but since January 2011 they are in seperate premises but are very close to each other and are both well decorated and equipped buildings. My daughter has loved the nursery and preschool and has had a great time with all the teachers at the nursery and pre school, each morning she is happy to go and she will miss the place. As a parent I have seen how my baby girl has changed to a little girl and has learnt so much from being at the nursery and kindergarten. It is a great nursery and kindergarten and from my experience it is a perfect place to send a young child. Please do not listern to someone who has not sent their children there, it is friendly and not to large so little children feel safe. <br><br>||', Question: for my 5 years old daughter taking into account that, she will most probably continue with english or american primary school.   ||', Comment Subject: Never heard of TEK???!!! <br><br>Comment Body: Never heard of TEK???!!! <br><br>||', Question: I am getting my dog(german shephard-male)from India shortly and I am looking for a suitable flatvilla for myself and my family where I can keep my dog without any problem,can anyone help me to locate the accomodation please ||', Comment Subject: RE: Keeping a German Shephard Dog in FlatVilla <br><br>Comment Body: There are lots of accomodations in qatar but with german shephard dog if you will ask accomodation i really sugest you to see some real estate agent.<br><br>||', Question: I am getting my dog(german shephard-male)from India shortly and I am looking for a suitable flatvilla for myself and my family where I can keep my dog without any problem,can anyone help me to locate the accomodation please ||', Comment Subject: RE: Keeping a German Shephard Dog in FlatVilla <br><br>Comment Body: Get a stand-alone villa with a garden. But remember, a dog is not usually welcome in most places in Qatar. We have a Saluki and have not been able to shift because of potential problems.<br><br>
