Go to the immigration and tell them your application rejected, 2. then they will give you meeting date may be after 3 months.(if you lucky u will get fast)  3. in the meeting they will ask few question and tell you to check after 3 days(may be you not allowed to ask the reason of the rejection) 4. If you lucky you will get the family visa. 5. After 3 days also its saying rejected you have to go again there. In that time they will say apply after one year. This is my own experience. I went there 3 times to know the reason of the rejection. they reply  Yalla go come after one year   specially if you are English speaking.   They failed to put even  English speaking workers in the main immigration  .   I know this will not happen to all.  <br><br>||', Question: Can anybody tell me where can I see the reasons why visas are being rejected. ||', Comment Subject: They wont tell you their <br><br>Comment Body: They wont tell you their reasons.<br><br>||', Question: Can anybody tell me where can I see the reasons why visas are being rejected. ||', Comment Subject: thank you guys for all your <br><br>Comment Body: thank you guys for all your info, most especially to anilarch3d, your inputs helped me alot.<br><br>||', Question: Can anybody tell me where can I see the reasons why visas are being rejected. ||', Comment Subject: hi <br><br>Comment Body: with me same  33348407<br><br>||', Question: All set to buy a new car but still the last minute confusion which one to go for.

Hmm. <br><br>Comment Body: Long distance? 120 km? Hmm. Anyhow, since 120 kmh is the maximum speed allowed in Qatar, and since every car sold in Qatar can reach that speed, it doesnt really matter which car you choose. Any car will do.<br><br>
