Have someone asking for 2500 a month as a live out and 2 days off a week - is this around the going rate.<br><br>||', <b>Short Question:</b> maids wages<br><br><b>Full Question:</b> What would you expect to pay for a full time or part time maid with sponsorship and without?<br><br>Many thanks||', <b>Response Subject:</b> Becs<br><br><b>Response Body:</b> No  that is far and above what others are paying.<br>The top rate for a live-in is 1500QR a month with 1 12 days off a week.   Anything above that and you are getting scammed.<br><br>It does cost more in the long run for a live-out, so determine carefully exactly how often you think you will need the services.  In most cases it is cheaper to get a live-in.  However then you have to supervise more and put up with sponsorship etc.<br><br>For example, I have a part-time cleaner who comes 2 mornings a week.   I pay her 150QR each time (30QR an hour--she is great so I pay more---plus taxi fee).  So each month I pay her about 1200QR  for part time.  I could have full-time for almost that amount. But I dont want to deal with sponsoring anyone, or have a stranger live in my house.  Plus I am a firm believer in teaching my children to work and dont want someone picking up after them.   So for me, I would rather pay more for a part-time cleaner.   <br><br>It all depends on your family situation and what your needs are.<br><br>||', <b>Short Question:</b> Where can i buy sona masoori rice?
