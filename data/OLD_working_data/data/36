Question: Hello,  This may sound strange but is gardening in Qatar possible? Or is the climate too hot? I love to garden. I have some tomatoes, peppers and herbs right now in pots in my terrace. Wondering if I could possibly grow anything in pots there? Thanks ||', Response:Yes, it is possible. But it is a hit and miss thing. right now it is easy, as it is not so hot, later on you need to water twice a day and need to keep your plants in the shade. The plants you see around Doha are obviously those you may be able to keep alive here. Also, the soil here is extremely poor, you need to fertilize accordingly.<br><br>||', Question: Hello,  This may sound strange but is gardening in Qatar possible? Or is the climate too hot?
