If you are near Doha Zoo then its just a couple of blocks away from that place. Its in Al Fereej, Murra - the name of the shop is MURRA LADY TAILOR, the color of the signboard is Purple. Just bring your old scrubs or just a copy then they will make it for you. You can also try to ask any tailor shop that you can see and there are a lot of tailors here in Qatar.<br><br>||', Question: Can anyone help me in giving some information regarding Qatar Prometric exam for Nurses and what the requirement to sit for the exam?   ||', Response: https:www.prometric.comen-usPageshome.aspx  here schedule the test online and pay using a credit card.. its a 70 items test and you have to get at least half to pass.
