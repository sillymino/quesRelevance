Question: What would you expect to pay for a full time or part time maid with sponsorship and without?  Many thanks   ||', Response: Great thanks.  What the going rate for live in or live out. Have someone asking for 2500 a month as a live out and 2 days off a week - is this around the going rate.    <br><br>||', Question: What would you expect to pay for a full time or part time maid with sponsorship and without?  Many thanks   ||', Response: No  that is far and above what others are paying. The top rate for a live-in is 1500QR a month with 1 12 days off a week.   Anything above that and you are getting scammed.  It does cost more in the long run for a live-out, so determine carefully exactly how often you think you will need the services.  In most cases it is cheaper to get a live-in.  However then you have to supervise more and put up with sponsorship etc.  For example, I have a part-time cleaner who comes 2 mornings a week.   I pay her 150QR each time (30QR an hour--she is great so I pay more---plus taxi fee).  So each month I pay her about 1200QR  for part time.  I could have full-time for almost that amount. But I dont want to deal with sponsoring anyone, or have a stranger live in my house.  Plus I am a firm believer in teaching my children to work and dont want someone picking up after them.   So for me, I would rather pay more for a part-time cleaner.     It all depends on your family situation and what your needs are. <br><br>||', Question: What would you expect to pay for a full time or part time maid with sponsorship and without?

Maybe some activities in a  group , arts and crafts, or sports, or something in that way, so she can socializes with kids . I would like to hear from you , thank you guys :) ||', Response: available in doha.   Everything from swimming to gymnastics to sailing, ballet, cooking, arts and crafts, etc.  My best suggestion is to get hold of a Marhaba Guide book from your nearest grocery store and read the dozens of pages that tell what activities are available for children.   Let your daughter pick her favorite.   good luck.<br><br>||', Question: I looking for some ideas and suggestions on what a 9 year old girl could do for fun activities in the afternoon, preferably with other girls ?!
