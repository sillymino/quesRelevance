Question: Is there a market in Doha that sells SushiSashimi grade fish? (e.g. Tuna, Salmon, Snapper etc.)  Note: I am looking for a market - please dont direct me to Sushi restaurants.  Thanks! ||', Response:Theres a fish market across from the place where you take the Drivers License test (i forgot the name of that office). Anyway, its the same highway that you travel to go to QDC.   You have to go there early mornings though.
