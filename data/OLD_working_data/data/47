This is clearly showing in Immigration office in Garafa in the list of fees, you can ask any of the immigration member of staff and he will tell you.  However, if you are unable to bring your family under the labors law,you are adviced to extend her vsist visa before its due,simply the penalty is big and to my knoweledge around 200 QRDay or even more <br><br>
