Thank you guys... ||', Response:but dont know the process. It is possible.<br><br>||', Question: Can my sponsor cancel my visa even without my passport? Thank you guys... ||', Response:the RP ID (together with your passport) should be submitted to the Immigration to cancel it.   &lt;b&gt;HOWEVER&lt;b&gt;, THEY(your sponsor) can report you to the CID as abscondingabsconded to release them of any responsibility of you. When they get that clearance from the authorities, they will no longer issue you an NOC letter, and may even report your whereabouts to the police and have you deported. That would be the worst scenario.  This happened to someone I know 2 years ago. Im not sure if the procedure changed.  <br><br>||', Question: Can my sponsor cancel my visa even without my passport?
